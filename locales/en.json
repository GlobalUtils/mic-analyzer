    "faq3Question": "Why isn't my mic test working?",
    "faq3Answer": "Check these common issues: 1. Microphone permission was denied (look in your browser's site settings). 2. No microphone is connected or it's disabled in your system settings. 3. The wrong microphone is selected in the dropdown. 4. Your browser might be outdated or doesn't support the necessary Web Audio features (try Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari). 5. Your microphone might be muted.",

    "faq5Question": "What do the visualizations mean?",
    "faq5Answer": "The Volume Meter shows how loud the input sound is in real-time. The Waveform displays the actual shape of the sound wave as it changes over time. The Frequency Spectrum shows the intensity of different pitches in the sound â€“ low frequencies (bass) are on the left, high frequencies (treble) are on the right.",
